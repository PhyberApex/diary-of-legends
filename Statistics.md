# Statistics #
For every statistic you are able to insert a parameter into the textfield next to the dropdown menu. This is e.g. for champion names which you can seperate using ";". So an input for Game Statistics with "Lee;Elise" would return the statistics for Lee Sind and Elise where for an input like "u;e" it would give you the statistic for every champion that has a "u" or an "e" in his name.


You are able to create following statistics:
  * [Game statistics](GameStatistics.md)
  * [Top 3 enemies per champion](Top3PerChampStat.md)
  * [Top 3 enemies for multiple champions](Top3MultChampStat.md)
