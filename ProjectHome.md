This application is no longer supported due to the unavailability of the elophant API on which this programm heavily relied on. Sorry guys!

# Diaray of Legends #
Did you ever wanted to know:
  * what is my strongest pick?
  * which champion gives me the most trouble?
  * how many minions have I slain?
  * ...

Well then **Diary of Legends** may be for you. It is a tool designed to keep track of your accomplishments. You have to insert your data manually or you import the .rofl file from your previous play.

Do you want to pick the champion you will most likely win with?

Start gathering your data today!

Statistics aren't that great as of now. But I'll soon update some nice statistic views. Maybe even some graphs in the future.
