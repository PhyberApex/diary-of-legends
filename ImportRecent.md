# Import of recent matches #
This option will gather your last matches from the elophant api(which are the most recent 10) and prompt you with the ones that weren't bot or custom games. You can then choose which of them you want to import. The same stats will be imported as by the import of [`\*`.rofl files](ImportRofl.md) except the length of the game which is also not included in the api.
