= Statistics =
For every statistic you are able to insert a parameter into the textfield next to the dropdown menu. This is e.g. for champion names which you can seperate using ";". So an input for Game Statistics with "Lee;Elise" would return the statistics for Lee Sind and Elise where for an input like "u;e" it would give you the statistic for every champion that has a "u" or an "e" in his name.


You are able to create following statistics:
 * [GameStatistics Game statistics]
 * [Top3PerChampStat Top 3 enemies per champion]
 * [Top3MultChampStat Top 3 enemies for multiple champions]
